# The Story Behind Sans-Capote

## Why I Built This

In 2024, I had an HIV scare and realized I didn't have the support, resources, or safe space to feel secure in myself. I feared that a positive result would be seen as a moral failure rather than a health condition. 

This experience made me determined to create Sans-Capote: a platform where people can access accurate sexual health information, guidance, and local services in a non-judgmental, stigma-free environment. My goal is to ensure that no one faces the fear, shame, or misinformation I experienced — and to help break down the stigma surrounding sexual health in African contexts.

**Sans-Capote is personal. It's the tool I wish I had when I needed it most.**

## What People Are Saying

Real voices from our community highlight why this work matters:

> **"And I thought antibiotics cured HIV."**  
> — Caleb

> **"Maybe it won't be so hard to talk about living with HIV someday"**  
> — Amaka

> **"People need SexED in Africa and we need to stop being scared of bringing it up."**  
> — Chiagozie B.

> **"The rates at which people have unprotected sex, I think this app can help change the motion."**  
> — Timilehin

> **"Never been quizzed before on HIV. The certificate thing is cool."**

These statements reflect the knowledge gaps, stigma, and urgent need for accessible sexual health education across Sub-Saharan Africa—exactly what Sans-Capote is built to address.

## The Silence That Kills

Imagine a 19-year-old girl who thinks she might have HIV. She can't ask her mother. She can't ask her friends. She can't go to a clinic without risking judgment or gossip in her community. So she stays silent—while the virus progresses, while her anxiety grows, while preventable transmission continues.

This isn't a hypothetical scenario. **It's the reality for millions of young people across Sub-Saharan Africa.**

### The Global Challenge

- **37.7M people live with HIV globally**, yet 80% don't have access to preventive services
- In Sub-Saharan Africa, **stigma and privacy concerns** prevent people from seeking health information
- Low-literacy users, poor internet, and misinformation make voice-based education critical
- **Young people (15-24) account for 30% of new HIV infections**, yet lack safe spaces to ask questions

### Why These Pilot Countries?

Our initial focus on **Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, and Ghana** is strategic and data-driven:

**High HIV Burden:**
- **South Africa:** 7.5M people living with HIV—the world's largest epidemic
- Combined, these countries account for **~40% of global HIV burden** yet face critical resource constraints

**Misinformation Crisis:**
- Widespread myths about HIV transmission (mosquito bites, witchcraft, sharing utensils)
- Language barriers and stigma prevent people from seeking accurate information

**Digital Opportunity:**
- 60%+ mobile penetration creates opportunity for voice-first, SMS-based health education
- High trust in SMS/voice communication over apps

Sans-Capote addresses these challenges by providing **accurate, stigma-free information** in users' preferred language, accessible via voice or text, with locally-relevant resources and community-verified service ratings.

## About the Name

**"Sans-Capote"** is French for "without a sheath/cover." While this phrase has literal connotations, we've chosen it as a metaphor for **removing the barriers of stigma and silence** surrounding sexual health education. 

Just as transparency requires removing covers, our mission is to create open, judgment-free conversations about topics that are often hidden or taboo. This name reflects our commitment to addressing sexual health with directness, honesty, and compassion.

**Note for Reviewers:** We acknowledge the dual meaning and welcome feedback on whether a different name (e.g., "Open Health," "Clear Talk," "Sans Tabou") would better serve our mission while maintaining cultural sensitivity.

## Impact & Vision

Sans-Capote is more than a health app—it's a movement to:
- **Break the silence** around sexual health in African contexts
- **Empower young people** with accurate, stigma-free information
- **Connect communities** to judgment-free, verified health services
- **Normalize conversations** about HIV, STIs, consent, and prevention

Every voice interaction, every service discovered, every rating submitted is a step toward a future where sexual health is treated with the same openness and compassion as any other aspect of well-being.
